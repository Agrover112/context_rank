SEMANTYC

Semantyc is a contextual mobile search engine that is user/ "People" centric and returns results to queries which is relevent and personalized to the user and is based on the meaning of the query of the user rather than the keywords in the query.



On todays web information is distributed across various websites/platforms and is available in various foms of media which forces any user to surf mltiple websites and use various services to accomplish a certain task or get releant information on a certain query;todays traditional search is driven by advertisement and seo protocols rather than "People".


Moving furthur down the problem even after the user is directed towards the relevant website; it is almost always the case that the website provides a gigantic amount of information rather than the specific query,or the summary of the relevant information that the user is looking to find the answer for! Ths requiring the user to furthur dig into the pile of information and other hyperlinks/media to findthe desired outcome.



It is "User-centric" and optimises itself to look for the resourcs/media/services that the user is looking for by trying to extract the context/meaning from the query using machine learning,natural language processing techniques, and recommendation systems and combining it with the information extracted by the users past behaviour to return the best possible results to the user.


The next power that semantyc provides the user is connecting the services that the users search for together as well,cross-referencing information seamlessly on the same interface the entire personalized search can further be saved and shared with other users to collaborrate on a certain task. The search feed can be made public for other users to view, take notes on the same.
